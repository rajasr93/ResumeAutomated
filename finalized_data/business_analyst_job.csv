operational support from CFOs, Controllers, FP&A Managers, and Accounting Managers.

* Prepare detailed reporting on unit economics and margin analysis
* Prepare annual and quarterly budgets for multiple clients
* Collaborate with accounting teams to understand underlying data
* Perform ad-hoc analysis for clients on pricing strategy, margin sensitivity, cash burn scenarios, etc.

JD Edwards Business Analyst,RSM Solutions Inc,"Itasca, IL","Thank you for taking time to stop by and take a look at the BA role I have posted on Indeed. If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new to my job descriptions, welcome to the party.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

* This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
* No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

* Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
* Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
* Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
* Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
* Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
* Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
* Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
* Experience performing unit and integration testing.
* Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.
* Experience with AS IS Analysis, Mapping of JDE within existing systems, creating setups, User Training, Testing (unit and Integration), giving solutions to the client issues, data loading, Creating Menus Versions, Defining setups, Integration with other modules, preparation, and finalization of specs for report, documentation of the Business Processes, Setups, and User Manuals.

The Sr. Business Analyst works closely with the customer team, judicial partners, vendors and the application development and analysis teams to identify needs, solve immediate problems and create a higher quality product.
