Startup Financial Analyst,Forecastr INC,"Louisville, KY","**Forecastr - Startup Financial Analyst**

**Intro to Forecastr**  
Forecastr is a rapidly-growing, venture backed, SaaS company out of Louisville, Kentucky building an online software platform that helps founders build great financial models, make better decisions, and get funded.

We’ve been on-fire since raising our pre-seed of $750k in Q1 2020 and going full-time and to date we've raised $9M in Venture Capital, have ~700 paying customers, $2.1M ARR, and 30 FTEs.

Our product is an online financial model for startups, served as Plug & Play Financial Planning & Analysis and sold on a monthly subscription basis with a 30-Day, ‘White-Glove’ onboarding. During onboarding we take a “deep-dive” to fully understand our customer’s “ins and outs” and help them get a great, ‘investor-grade’ financial model. We then take ownership of the financial model and deliver consistent reporting and insights to drive data-backed value for the founder on an on-going basis!

**Forecastr Culture**  
We believe culture is vitally important, and it’s crucial that you know the culture of the company you are considering working for, to best understand if it’s a good match.

At Forecastr, we believe in a fast-paced but balanced culture that is performance-driven. There is a lot of flexibility in terms of work hours, vacation time, and work style, so long as you excel in your role, and are playing your part to ensure the company achieves its most important objectives.

Our company values are as follows:

**Put People First**: We prioritize the well-being and growth of our employees, fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.

**Inspire Confidence:** We strive to embody the confidence our customers need to close funding rounds and grow their companies. We lead by example.

**Be Prepared:** We plan for the future, and always keep one eye on the horizon, never losing sight of the forest for the trees.

**Live with balance:** We encourage a harmonious integration of work and personal life, recognizing the importance of maintaining well-rounded lifestyles for sustained success.

**Have Fun:** We believe that a joyful and vibrant workplace cultivates creativity, collaboration, and overall satisfaction among our team members.

**Speak the truth:** We foster a culture of open and honest communication in an empathetic manner, promoting transparency and integrity in all interactions to drive meaningful progress.
