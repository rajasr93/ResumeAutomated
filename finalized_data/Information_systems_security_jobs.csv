When you are not in the office, you will need the following to succeed in this role:

* Reliable Internet Connection: You will need to provide your own high-speed and stable internet connection which is necessary to ensure seamless communication, access to online tools, and the ability to collaborate with team members effectively.
* Suitable Workspace: You should have a dedicated workspace that is free from distractions and provides a comfortable and ergonomic setup. This includes a suitable desk, chair, and appropriate lighting that ensure your health and comfort during work hours.
* Minimal Background Noise: Since remote work involves virtual meetings and calls, it is important to minimize background noise and maintain a professional environment. Having a quiet space free from disruptions is crucial during client interactions, team discussions, and video conferences.
* Equipment and Technology: The agency will provide you with a computer/laptop, headset, and any other necessary equipment required to perform your job functions remotely.

While working in a remote office setting, physical demands are generally minimal. However, it is important to be aware of certain considerations related to ergonomics and health. Please take note of the following:

* Ergonomic Workspace: Setting up an ergonomic workstation is essential to promote comfort and prevent potential physical strains. This includes having a proper chair, desk, and computer setup that ensures good posture and minimizes the risk of musculoskeletal issues.
* Computer Usage: Most of the work will involve computer-based tasks, such as using software applications, typing, and utilizing online communication tools. It is important to be mindful of your posture, take regular breaks for stretching or resting your eyes, and maintain appropriate lighting conditions.
* Movement and Stretching: While not a physical demand in the traditional sense, it is crucial to incorporate movement and stretching into your remote work routine. Regular breaks to stand up, walk, stretch, or exercise can improve circulation, reduce muscle tension, and enhance overall well-being.
* Self-care and Wellness: Working remotely can blur the line between work and personal life. Prioritizing self-care and creating a healthy work-life balance is crucial. It is important to maintain regular exercise, eat balanced meals, and practice self-care activities to support both your physical and mental well-being.


As with any office-based or remote work, it is important to be mindful of your own health and comfort. Creating a suitable workspace, practicing good ergonomics, and incorporating healthy habits will contribute to a positive work environment and promote overall job satisfaction.

For more than 40 years, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence has been the leading national voice in the prevention of gun violence with an unrivaled history of success. The Brady Bill, which was signed into law in 1993, remains the single most effective gun violence prevention policy in history, with Brady background checks blocking more than 3 million sales of guns to prohibited purchasers such as domestic abusers, convicted violent criminals, and people with dangerous mental illnesses. In the words of President Bill Clinton, “countless people are alive today” because of the work of Jim and Sarah Brady and the Brady Center.

We believe that these communities must be centered in the work we do. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities and lived experiences."
