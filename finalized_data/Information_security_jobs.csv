Security Intern,Urbane Security,"Chicago, IL","### **Description**


Looking to grow in the security field? Have a passion and drive that goes beyond your education?


Urbane is seeking the most talented, driven, and intelligent interns to help our Security Services teams secure the largest and most interesting organizations, platforms, and products in the world. From large-scale cloud platforms to the newest mobile applications; global financial processing to regional healthcare providers; cutting edge devops environments to traditional corporate enterprises - Urbane is called on to help organizations face unique, highly technical, and critical challenges.


In this role, you’ll assist the Security Services teams, which include both offensive and defensive, in performing security research, developing internal tools, and delivering on client engagements, ranging from security assessments to solution implementations. Given your expertise and drive, you’ll face diverse challenges and gain invaluable experience. You’ll have the opportunity to excel independently while having an expert team drive you to achieve your best and back you up with the diverse challenges you’ll face.


With Urbane you’ll have the power to make a difference and face real challenges: improving environments security, advising teams on the most effective ways to address the core security problems, and address real security problems. Challenges vary week to week and provide a wealth of experience.


Sound like an exciting challenge and a cause you can get behind? Read on.


### **Who You Are**


You should possess the following key character traits:


* Creative, out-of-the-box thinker who can leverage various domains of knowledge to create uniquely tailored tests and solutions for complex problems. You’re curious by nature, intrigued by how things work, and have an appetite to find weaknesses in their design and implementation.
* You’re passionate about technology and find entertainment in crazy personal projects (i.e., programming a USB Nerf gun and webcam to mess with your cat while you aren’t at home, building an enterprise-grade virtualization environment in your bedroom closet, or seeing how many neighbors think your “free” wifi is actually “free”).
* You prefer building, contributing, and leading over falling in line. You’re happy to take the initiative in building a tool or resource that makes everyone’s lives easier.
* A desire to stay current with the latest technologies, attacks, and hardening strategies. You’re a regular online reader of blogs and social media for the latest in security, enjoy good conference talks, and/or contribute to interesting projects.
* Highly organized and detail-oriented with the ability to independently prioritize multiple projects while still balancing personal goals. You recognize when you need help, and aren’t afraid to ask for it.
* Driven personality, with a desire to continuously improve, put in the hours, and deliver. You take pride in your work, and you want it to be the best you can do.
* Have a strong ethical compass and an understanding of ethics in business and information security. You’ll respect scope limitations, clean up after your attacks, and never access or retain data that isn’t pertinent to the testing.
* Maintain a unique and independent identity, but respect other business’ culture, including dress apparel, level of formality, and work schedules. We maintain a startup-style culture internally, while presenting a clean, elevated, and refined image to the rest of the world.
* Currently a US citizen or other permanent US resident.
* Current residing in the Chicago-land area.

### **What You Have Done**


We care more about knowledge drive over pieces of paper to serve as proof. As such, we’re looking for the following:


* Currently pursuing a degree in a technical computer field, including, but not limited to, defensive security, offensive security, network technologies, software development, and information systems.
* Have a technical knowledge and understanding of mixed-technology environments, include diverse operating systems, network hardware, web application languages, administration technologies, authentication mechanisms, and cloud platforms.
* Developed or modified tools in scripting languages, such as Go, Ruby, Python, Perl, or Java.
* Have learned the core fundamentals of computers, all the way down to protocol stacks.
* Paid enough attention in English class to write good (or is it well?).

### **What We Prefer (but do not require)**


* Are active in industry groups (e.g., OWASP, DEF CON Groups, City-Sec Meetups, or other security meetups) and/or conferences (e.g., DEFCON, ShmooCon, Summercon, DerbyCon, THOTCON, BSides, BlackHat, etc.).
* Web application development experience in backend (PHP, Ruby, Python) and UI (HTML5/Javascript) to create multi-user interfaces to security tools.
* Have performed independent research, testing, or tool development on security issues out of curiosity.
* You prefer the words “information security” or “computer security” over “cyber”.

### **Who Is Urbane?**


Founded in 2009 and headquartered in the land of da Bears, da Bulls, da Delays at O'Hare, and winters leaving you wondering why you haven't moved yet, Urbane is an information security firm focused on elevating the level of security and compliance through uniquely tailored highly-technical engagements.

**Safety and Compliance:** This office leads the development, implementation, and management of the Airport Safety Management System (SMS). An SMS is a well-defined, systematic, integrated, and proactive safety program. Safety is not addressed by a single department or as a separate entity, but as an overarching way of business. The Safety and Compliance intern will assist the Safety Management System (SMS) team with Risk Assessments through note taking, hazard processing and mitigation implementation. The Safety and Compliance intern will also support the SFO FAR 139 inspection process through data collection improvements, develop new Safety and Security Campaigns through cross divisional teamwork and coordination, and research and summarize new technology, regulations and processes that impact airports.

**Terminal Systems:** Terminal Systems is part of SFO’s Airport Services team, and responsible for developing and implementing airport policies and procedures for airline operations, passenger processing, and information systems, and facilities utilization in the airport terminal operating environment. The Terminal Systems intern will assist with the development and implementation of a Quality Assurance system for A-VGDS equipment and help establish an inventory system for Passenger Processing Systems and Information Displays.

**Marketing & Communications (MarComm):** No two days are ever the same in the MarComm department with responsibilities that run the gamut from corporate and internal communications to marketing campaigns to project management. The MarComm Intern will work side-by-side with SFO’s Marketing & Communications team in a fast paced and fun environment, allowing them the opportunity to grow their experience, hone their understanding, and apply their skills to real-time, meaningful projects and assignments.

The MarComm intern will complete a project that supports SFO but is tailored around personal interests and skills. Past projects have included: producing an episode of Inside SFO, writing a social media strategy paper, developing new sections of flysfo.com, and developing a video script and shot list. Projects and assignments may include: writing articles, conducting interviews, taking pictures, shooting video, posting content on websites and social media, interpreting marketing and social media analytics. To succeed, the MarComm Intern must have excellent communications skills, strong writing skills, an attention to detail, and familiarity with social media, photography and video production, web development and design. Must also be creative and willing to learn.

**Revenue Development and Management:** SFO’s Revenue Development and Management (RDM) resides in the Airport’s Financial and Commercial Division. RDM manages all commercial leasing activity and conducts daily property management functions for all on-airport property retail shops, food and beverage restaurants, rental car operations and various passenger services and related businesses. RDM is the prime liaison between all concession tenants and the airport for compliance with all contractual obligations, airport policies and coordination of property upkeep and maintenance.
